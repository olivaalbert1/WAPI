WAPI is designed for testers to practice API testing exercises.

Functionalities:
Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The API also supports data persistence, meaning data can be modified in a database for later retrieval. As it's possible to completely erase the database, a method to restore it to its original state is also provided. This API is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to it. Testers are encouraged to report bugs and suggest improvements to the API.
